                Possible issue identified with using ../ in the path of 
                configuration files passed in to the system. This will 
                be tested in a future version. Please do not specify the
                path of a configuration file in terms of ../. instead
                create an alias, the system will resolve the alias.
                
                The bug may have been introduced while attempting to
                add symbolic link de-referencing  code. This will
                probably become an option in the future so you
                can decide weather you would like symbolic links to be
