# rsync-wrapper shell script.  
# Licensed Under GNU GPL
#
# Written by  :   Mike Bombich
#
# Note :
# This script is not the latest version availible.
# Although this version has been extensivly tested with LBackup.
# It is reccomended that you obtain the latest version of this script 
# along with detailed instructions regarding the configuration of 
# SSH access from the following URL : 
#       http://www.bombich.com/mactips/rsync.html
#
# This script is executed when a user from a remote machine
# successfully authenticates with a public key.  

# The privileges of that user on this server are limited to the 
# functionality of this script. This wrapper script will verify 
# that the client is sending authorized command. If the command
# is authorized, then the original, unaltered command is run,
# if not, an error is returned. 
#
# By default this access attempts are logged in /var/logs/ 
# provided the script is run as root. However, if the script
# is executed by any other user on the system then the access
# logs will be stored in /tmp and therefore will not be
# kept on the system for long. 

# If you are using this script on a production system then
# a log rotation schedule should be configured and tested.
