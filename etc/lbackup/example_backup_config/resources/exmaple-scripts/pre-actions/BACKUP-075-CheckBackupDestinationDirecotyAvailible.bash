# This script requires LBackup 0.9.8r5 later.
#
# This script will stop the backup if the destination directory
# is not available. More recent versions of LBackup will perform
# this check regardless of whether you have this pre-action script
# enabled. However, pre-action scripts are run before this check is
# performed automatically by LBackup. If you have other pre-actions
# which depend upon the backup destination directory being present
# then you may enable this pre-action to make sure the backup directory
# is present before the backup moves ahead with other pre-action scripts.


## Configuration
