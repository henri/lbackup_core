#  This is a configuration file for the lbackup command.
#
#  Backup should be called as listed below :
#  eg . /usr/local/sbin/lbackup /path/to/this/script.conf
#
#  This configuration file requires 
#  LBackup version 0.9.8r5 or later.
#
#  For a less complex example backup configuration file visit : 
#  http://lucidsystems.org/tools/lbackup/instructions/setup

###########################    CONFIG-START    ##############################


# Version of Configuration File (Required)
 backupConfigurationVersion=1015


# SSH Settings
 sshRemoteUser="root"
 sshRemoteServer="192.168.1.100"



# Is the source for this backup located on a remote machine accessed via SSH (YES/NO) 
 useSSH="YES"



# Power management Settings
 # MAC address of machine to be woken
 hardware_address="00:03:93:B0:A0:BA"
 # determines weather or not to wake/sleep the client machine on the LAN (YES/NO) 
 WAKE="NO"
 SLEEP="NO"


# Send Growl Notification (YES/NO) 
 sendGrowlNotification="NO"


# Backup Source (no trailing slash is required)
 backupSource=/my_backup_test


# Backup Destination - note no back slashes are required (no trailing slash is required)
 backupDest="/Volumes/External Backup Drive/Back-Ups/test"



# Log Name

# excludes file - wildcard pattern per line of files to exclude (stored in this directory)
 excludes_filename=excludes.txt


## Availability Tests (YES/NO) 
 SSHTest="YES"
 PingTest="NO"
 



## Number of Rotations
 # Specify 1 to only keep the latest backup
 numRotations=8





##
## LBackup Reporting Options
##

# Report in a (human readable format) the amount of time required to remove
# the oldest backup snapshot and also any failed backup (YES/NO)
 # report_removal_times_human_readable="YES"

## Report in a (human readable format) the amount of time required for rsync 
# to complete the rsync snapshot (YES/NO)
 # report_snapshot_time_human_readable="YES"




###
### Mail Reporting Settings
###

# Name of the associated mail config file (file needs to be in same directory)
 mailconfigpartner=example_mail.conf
 
# Send an email even if the backup is successful. (YES/NO) 
#    Notes : Be warned if you have a lot of backups then you do not want to enable this.
#            Consider running lmail on a schedule or have a look at the lbackup home
#            and search for "monitoring multiple backup logs". This option will forward
#            the email using lmail. Enabling this option will result in the log being
#            archived. Finally, this is an experimental feature and it may be removed
#            in a future release.
# email_and_archive_log_on_successful_backup="NO"
 
 
 
 
 
 
##
## Change Logging ( requires rsync version 3 or later - experimental options) 
##
 
# List changes in the standard log file (YES/NO)
#   Note : This feature is experimental.
itemize_changes_to_standard_log="NO"

# List changes in a separate log file (YES/NO)
#   Note: If you would like to see which files are changing during a
#         backup then this is the recommended method. If enabled file 
#	      called "rsync_session.log" will be created within your 
#         configuration directory. This file will contain a list of 
#         changes as well as additional rsync information. This file
#         can easily grow very large. Therefore, if this option is
#         enabled it is recommended that this file is removed or 
#         archived by a pre or post action script.
enable_rsync_session_log="NO"






##
## Backup Lock Override (experimental option - may be removed from future version) 
##
 
#   Note : This feature is experimental. Only enable if you are sure that an override is required.
#          You may want to enable this feature if the user executing the backup dose not have 
#          write access to the backup directory. Future versions of LBackup may offer the
#          option of specifying the absolute lock file path from within the configuration
#          file.

# Ignore Backup Lock File (YES/NO)
# ignore_backup_lock="YES"






##
## Pre and Post Actions Scripts
##

# Leaving the backup_pre_action_script or the backup_post_action_script blank
# or removing these directives, will result in the default scripts checking
# the "pre-action" and the "post-action" folders within the "resources"
# folder for scripts prefixed with "BACKUP" to be execute.


# Pre-Actions - Script Run Prior to Backup
 backup_pre_action_script=""

# Post-Actions - Script Run After Backup
 backup_post_action_script=""

# Post-Actions - Perform Post Actions Even if there an error occurs during the backup
#    Note : This is an experimental feature. Only enable if you are sure that an override is required.
#           Only enable this feature once understand and accept the associated dangers.
#
# Continue With Post Actions On Backup Error(s) (YES/NO)
# post_actions_on_backup_error="NO"




##
## LBackup Rsync Options 
##

# If you are using Mac OS X on both the client and server then you should
# be able to leave this section commented out. A later version of LBackup
# may provide support for different version of Rsync another way. As such,
# these options may change in future LBackup releases.

# Override Rsync Path when backup occurs via SSH (eg. /usr/bin/rsync)
 
 #ssh_rsync_path_remote="/usr/bin/rsync"            # ( Use standard version of Rsync - LINUX - Client )
 #ssh_rsync_path_local="/usr/bin/rsync"             # ( Use standard version of Rsync - LINUX - Server )
 
 #ssh_rsync_path_remote="/usr/local/bin/rsync_v3"   # ( Use custom version of rsync - OSX - Client)
 #ssh_rsync_path_local="/usr/local/bin/rsync_v3"    # ( Use custom version of rsync - OSX - Server)
 
 
# Use this custom rsync path if we are performing a local backup on Darwin
 # custom_rsync_path_local_darwin="/usr/local/bin/rsync_v3"
 
  
# Override local system checks (YES/NO)
 #check_local_system="NO" # (Bypasses the local system checks)

# Disable ACL preservation, only availible on darwin with custom rsync (YES/NO)
 #disable_acl_preservation="YES" # (If enabled ACL's will not be preserved in the backup)

# Enable the rsync --numeric-ids option (YES/NO)
 # numeric_ids_enabled="NO" # (If enabled then the --numeric-ids option will be passed to rsync)

# Enable the rsync --checksum option (YES/NO)
 # checksum_enabled="NO" # (If enabled then the --checksum option will be passed to rsync)


# Allow the use of the standard version of rsync when performing the backup (YES/NO)
# If the remote OS is Mac OS X 10.3.9 or earlier then it is recommend that this option is set to "NO"
 # ssh_permit_standard_rsync_version="YES"
