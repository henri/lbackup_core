LBackup uses rsync to copy and compare files. It is important that the copy of rsync installed and referenced by LBackup supports coping metadata which you or your policies require. Check the online documentation for the latest information regarding compiling and installing rsync, particularly if you are running Mac OS X. Also note that many versions of rsync which are available do not work correctly with symbolic links. Ensure that your version is working if you have symbolic links in your backup tree.

LBackup is released to help systems administrators manage small backup clusters. It is advisable that logs are checked by an automated system to ensure backups have succeeded and no errors have occurred. Backup verification is also very important. Do not assume that backups are good, just because LBackup did not report an error. Please refer to the LBackup documentation or contact Lucid for information regarding the monitoring of multiple backups across multiple backup up servers. If you would like to setup automatic monitoring of multiple backups then you may also want to look at the example scripts available from the LBackup website.

Before using LBackup, ensure that you have understood your backup policy. This will ensure that you are adhering to this policy and determine if LBackup is the right tool for you.
